## Hi there! üëã I'm Piyush Singh

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Data Scientist with a background in Mechanical Engineering. I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science (Social Analytics) at the University of Manchester. My work revolves around leveraging data to build intelligent systems and applications, with a particular focus on chatbot development using Large Language Models (LLMs).

### üöÄ What I'm working on:

- **Particle System in Three.js**: I'm working on a particle system to simulate the fluid, eerie movement of dementors from Harry Potter, integrated into a React app.
- **Chatbot Development**: I'm exploring the use of LLMs to create chatbots for various applications, including one for my personal portfolio website.

### üå± What I'm learning:

- **Cryptography**: Diving into the world of cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
- **Nuclear & Quantum Physics**: Expanding my knowledge in these fascinating fields.
- **Scalable Systems on AWS**: Optimizing the deployment of applications on AWS, focusing on scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### üíº My Experience:

- **Mechanical Engineering**: I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking.
- **Data Science**: My journey into data science has led me to work on various projects, from social analytics to AI-driven applications.

### üìÇ Past Projects:

- **PsybeR-Cat**: PSybeR Cat is my final year mechanical engineering project, a 12-degree-of-freedom quadruped robot inspired by Boston Dynamics' Spot and MIT's Cheetah Robot. Designed for agility and capable of navigating uneven terrains, the robot was built using servo motors and FDM 3D printing. Two versions were developed, with ongoing improvements planned for future work.
